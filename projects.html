      I wanted to create a Basic Server with 4 methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
      focusing on the Post Method that has behind a (Request and Response Model) that will provide
      the user to input a firstName, a lastName, an email and a password getting as a response a
      UserId, his firstName, lastName and email.
      As a consequence of the user’s input on the first hand I wanted to store his password
      in the database (for this I used the path from UserRequest to UserResponse throw the DTO,
      UserEntity, UserServiceImpl, UserService interface and UserRepository making use of the
      Crud Repository). On the second hand I wanted the email to be unique for every new user that
      was provided from the Post method so I created a costume 500 error message to handle the
      duplicate entry’s using a method in the Service Repository that the Service Implementation
      Class used codding an if statement that will throw a new RuntimeException.

    </ol>
    <p>As a result of an Udemy course that offered as challenge to create an application in
      order to manager the process of selling hamburgers I wanted to create a program that would
      combine and use all the Java-OOP pillars (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and
      Polymorphism) that I got familiar with.This application is able to select types of burgers and some of the additional items that
      are added to the burgers and pricing. I created a base Hamburger (Class), with two other types
      of hamburgers.
      The Hamburger (Class) has the following items.
    <ul>
      <li>Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot,
        etc.) that the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items gets charged
        an additional price in order to calculate the final price. (base burger with all the additions)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Two extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses):
    <ol type="a">
      <li> HealthyBurger (Class) plus two addition items that can be added.
        <ul>
          <li>The Healthy Burger has 6 items (Additions) in total.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>DeluxeBurger (Class) comes with chips and drinks as additions.
        <ul>
          <li>No extra additions are allowed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    All 3 classes have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the
    hamburger plus all the additions, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a
    grand/final total for the burger (base price + all additions).
